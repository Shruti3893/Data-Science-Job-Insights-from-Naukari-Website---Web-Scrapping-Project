We are the country s premium data science team featured widely in press and news; see:
In the past year, the data science team at Delhivery has built key capabilities in the following areas:

Maps: Our business relies heavily on understanding where our end customers live and how to get there. This is a huge India specific challenge, primarily because of the unstandardized way of writing addresses and poor quality of road/ pincode data in smaller towns/ villages. We process a large amount of location data from our devices on the ground to learn locality boundaries, routes taken by ground staff, etc.
Machine Learning: We use a range of machine learning techniques to automate decision making at the ground level, e.g., identifying whether a shipment is safe to fly based on its product description, identifying which shipments have a high probability of being returned, etc.
Discrete Optimisation: We rely on a range of optimisation methods to ensure our distribution network is designed for cost efficiencies and scale, e.g., Vehicle Routing Problem to optimise the shipment collection process from clients, Facility Location Problem to ensure our distribution centres are suitably located, etc.
Simulation: The scale of our distribution network often makes many problems intractable due to the existence of millions of variables and how they interact with each other over time. We are investing to build an in- house Simulator to enable us to measure the impact of changes in the network over time and ultimately design a system that can be self aware .We are looking to expand our team to further our capabilities in the area of Machine Learning.
